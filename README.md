Lexical Analyzer
Description
This project is a lexical analyzer implemented in C++. A lexical analyzer (or lexer) is a critical component of a compiler that processes an input source code and converts it into a sequence of tokens. Each token represents a string with an assigned and thus identified meaning. This lexical analyzer is designed to read source code, identify tokens, and handle errors gracefully.

Features
Token Identification: Recognizes various tokens from the source code including keywords, identifiers, operators, and literals.
Error Handling: Detects and reports lexical errors in the input source code.
State Management: Efficiently manages states to process the input using a state machine approach.
Installation
To compile and run the lexical analyzer, you need to have a C++ compiler installed on your machine. Follow the steps below to set up and run the project:

Clone the Repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/lexical-analyzer.git
cd lexical-analyzer
Compile the Code:

sh
Copy code
g++ -o LexicalAnalyzer LexicalAnalyzer.cpp
Run the Executable:

sh
Copy code
./LexicalAnalyzer
Usage
To use the lexical analyzer, you need to provide an input source code file. The lexer will read this file and output the identified tokens and any lexical errors encountered.

Example
Input Source Code File (input.txt):

arduino
Copy code
int main() {
    int number = 42;
    printf("Hello, World!");
    return 0;
}
Running the Lexer:

sh
Copy code
./LexicalAnalyzer input.txt
Output:

vbnet
Copy code
Token: int
Token: main
Token: (
Token: )
Token: {
Token: int
Token: number
Token: =
Token: 42
Token: ;
Token: printf
Token: (
Token: "Hello, World!"
Token: )
Token: ;
Token: return
Token: 0
Token: ;
Token: }
